Hey there! I am Andrea, a machine learning researcher with over 6 years of experience.

In the last 4 years, my research focus has been on privacy-preserving machine learning and the security and safety of AI.
I spend my time developing and conducting experiments to enhance model security and data confidentiality.

I’ve been lucky enough to work with some great teams along the way.
Most recently, I worked within the [Machine Learning and Data Management Group](https://www.sba-research.org/research/research-groups/mldm/) at [SBA Research](https://www.sba-research.org/), where I focused on addressing challenges in the domain of secure and privacy-preserving machine learning. My work encompassed exploring data anonymization techniques, intentional memorization in ML models, as well as the mitigation of training data exfiltration.
I have also developed defense applications implemented in a federated learning platform for healthcare applications [FeatureCloud](https://www.featurecloud.eu), which offer protection against exfiltration risks, while maintaining model utility.

Moreover, I was able to gain experience in computer vision and climate research. I led a climate research project [gAia](https://www.sba-research.org/research/projects/gaia/)
spanning 2.5 years, which was a part of the [Austrian Security Research Programme](https://www.kiras.at/en/home/). The project focused on landslide risk assessment from multimodal data, such as satellite images, climatology and weather data.
Furthermore, as a researcher at [WU](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/) (Vienna University of Economics and Business), I contributed to the development of advanced object detection and image segmentation approaches on satellite imagery within the [ReKlaSAT3D](https://austria-in-space.at/en/projects/2016/reklasat-3d.php) project, a part of the [Austrian Space Application Programme](https://www.ffg.at/content/austrian-space-applications-programme) (ASAP).

As for my academic journey, I completed my [Master’s in Data Science](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/master/data-science/) at [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/) (Vienna University of Technology).
In my [diploma thesis](https://doi.org/10.34726/hss.2023.92803) I focused on the intersection of data privacy and the security of machine learning models. More specifically, I simulated and evaluated data exfiltration attacks on neural networks and developed defenses against them.

If you’re excited about the intersection of AI, security, and privacy as well, let’s chat! There’s still a lot to cover in this field, and I’m always up for a brainstorming session or collaboration.
