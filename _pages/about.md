Hey there! I am Andrea, a machine learning researcher with over 6 years of experience. In the last 4 years, my research focus has been on privacy-preserving machine learning and the security and safety of AI.
I spend my time developing and conducting experiments to enhance model security and data confidentiality.
I’ve been lucky enough to work with some great teams along the way, I was able to gain experience in computer vision and climate research. I led a climate research project [gAia](https://www.sba-research.org/research/projects/gaia/) spanning 2.5 years, focusing on landslide risk assessment from multimodal data, such as satellite images, climate and weather data.
Furthermore, as a researcher at [WU](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/) (Vienna University of Economics and Business), I contributed to the development of advanced object detection and image segmentation approaches on satellite imagery within the [ReKlaSAT3D](https://austria-in-space.at/en/projects/2016/reklasat-3d.php) project funded by the [Austrian Space Application Programme](https://www.ffg.at/content/austrian-space-applications-programme) (ASAP).

As for my academic journey, I completed my [Master’s in Data Science](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/master/data-science/) at [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/) (Vienna University of Technology). In my [diploma thesis](https://doi.org/10.34726/hss.2023.92803) I focused on the intersection of data privacy and the security of machine learning models. More specifically, I explored data exfiltration attacks on neural networks and developed defenses against them.

If you’re excited about the intersection of AI, security, and privacy as well, let’s chat! There’s still a lot to cover in this field, and I’m always up for a good brainstorming session or collaboration.
